Code Standards
for CeramicKoala

Variable and Method Declaration and Instantiation:
	-Place all class variable declarations at the top of the block (class, method, or logic block)
	-Group code blocks by logical function
		ex. in a method, separate blocks by 
			declarations, initializations, operations, output formatting and return

Debugging:
	-Use Log.d(String tag, String message) instead of System.out.println(String out)
	-Place all debug code in conditional blocks using BuildConfig.DEBUG as follows
		if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
			place code here
		}
     -display only pertinent debug information. If your code is standalone and simple, there's no need to debug it.

Formatting:
	-Break up long lines of code with the following rules:
		-break methods by placing each argument on a new line (Eclipse should auto-indent)
			ex. accountHelper.addElement(new Account(
										0, 
										user.getId(),name, 
										new Double(startingBalance), 
										new Double(interestRate))); 
		-make sure to correctly use spaces

Eclipse suggestions:
	-Follow most Eclipse suggestions (that do not have a large impact on the code)
		ex. use "Double.valueOf(int)" instead of "new Double(int)"

Logic:
      -Use as little data as necessary. Only use large data objects (Users, Accounts) for data display and editing. For things like logging in or populating a list of accounts, only store the pertinent information (username and password for logging in and account name, account Id for account list). The full object can always be retrieved later. 
     -make sure all objects and classes stay within the bounds of their responsibilities. When you write new code, make sure you are writing it in the best possible place.
